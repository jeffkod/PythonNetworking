# PythonNetworking
My adventures in python and networking - both traditional and SDN

Githib looks interesing ! you could pull the complete code base of projects like mininet sdn simulator , pox sdn controller etc in your machine!

And it has been one hell of an adventure..it involved a lot more than just scripting for networks - django,js,devops,management and even silly SikuliX.
